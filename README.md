# OpenGL_Game_with_Procedural_Racetrack

Written by Iulia-Silvia Plăiașu

Uses the https://github.com/UPB-Graphics/gfx-framework framework. It is an implementation for the second homework
from the Elements of Computer Graphics class, but with a racketrack which was not in the assigment.
(Assignment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyZwa6lDm14 )

Controls:

A, D - rotate left and right

W - move forwards

S - move backwards

Q, E - rotate camera around car

O - generate a new track

Z, X - zoom out minimap.


Run (and compile) with

mkdir build

cd build

cmake .. && cmake --build . && .\bin\Debug\GFXFramework

Dependencies that need to be installed depend on the GFXFramework
